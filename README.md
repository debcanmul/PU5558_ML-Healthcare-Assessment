Data was provided from NHS Digital -  Provisional Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in England before and after a Hip or Knee Replacement Procedure, from April 2020 to March 2021.

A Data Dictionary was provided.

For each of the following questions, choose a machine learning algorithm that could be used to answer it, and explain what makes it a suitable algorithm. 

Before the operation, can we:
Estimate the post-operative EQ5D index for a patient?
Predict how much pain a patient will have after the operation?
Calculate how many patients have had previous surgery?

Next, choose one of three questions above to answer with an appropriate machine learning model. (Only one of the three: you will not get additional marks for building more than one model.)

Briefly describe and include the R code to perform the following steps:
Data splitting
Selection and preprocessing of predictors
Model specification and training
Model evaluation
